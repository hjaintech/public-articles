### Engineering Competency Matrix

“What do I need to do to get promoted to the next level?”

“What are the expectations from my current level?”

These are the two questions everyone who works as a software engineer (or in any other field) in a company has.

These are very valid questions and your manager must answer them in the most precise manner. (Ask them now if you haven’t already)

Typically the expectations from your position can be divided into different areas. For example, you should ask, what is the expectation from me in terms of - 
Ownership of tasks
Complexity of tasks
Domain knowledge
Software Architecture
Coaching others
Security
Team Work
Decision making
Product Thinking
And so on.
These are just a few areas that were on top of my head. There can be a lot more as well. Also, not every level will have expectations in each of the areas. Finally, it also depends from company to company and team to team. But feel free to use the above as a starting point.

Also, most top tech companies aim to standardize this process for their company to reduce biases. They publish an Engineering competency document that lists the expectations from each level in as unambiguous a manner as possible. Do check out if your company already has one.

As an example, you can check out this public version of the CircleCI Engineering Competency Matrix - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131XZCEb8LoXqy79WWrhCX4sBnGhCM1nAIz4feFZJsEo/edit#gid=0
