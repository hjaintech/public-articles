Being a code ninja can enable you to get started as a Software Engineer (SWE). However, in today’s top product companies, it isn’t enough to be great at just programming.

To be a successful SWE, you’ll need to understand the business domain as well. Let’s see why.

As you grow in your role let’s say from SWE to SWE-2 to Senior SWE to Staff SWE (and so on), you’ll be expected to increasingly communicate with non-dev folks like Product Managers, UX designers, sales, marketing, Customer Support, etc. Most of these folks are going to have deep domain knowledge and they would expect you to have at least decent domain knowledge in order to effectively communicate and understand each other.

In addition to the above, having domain knowledge helps you view the features from the customer’s lens. At the end of the day, you are building those features to help the customer, not yourself. So you should be able to map every requirement to how it is going to make the lives of your customers better. For example, you get a requirement to open a marketing popup whenever the user lands on a payment page. You should be able to question if this might not be the best place to show that popup. The customer is about to make the payment and finish his current task. Showing a marketing popup at this point might add friction and in fact, could make users dismiss the popup right away (thereby reducing the conversion rate of the popup).

You should also step back and understand how a typical feature comes to life. In very simple terms, a Product Manager (PM) writes a Product Requirement Document (PRD), the UX designer designs the mockups. Finally, both PRD and mockups are handed over to the developers to start the development. From my experience, I can confidently tell you that the PRD and mockups are almost never fully sufficient. There will always be holes, missed scenarios, edge cases, etc. If you don’t have good domain knowledge, they won’t be able to pinpoint those. In fact, you might even end up making poor design choices early on in the development lifecycle.
All that being said, you don’t have to understand every minute detail of the domain. Nobody is asking you to be a domain expert. However, you should have a decent understanding of how customers use your software, how it is helping the customers, and what is it that it still lacks.

Finally, how can you learn about the business domain? Well, try the below pointers
Wear the user’s hat and play around with the product yourself. For example, you are working on a vendor-side app for an e-commerce company. Try to list new products in the test environment. Try to modify its inventory. Make a purchase as a customer. Try to understand how the sales data is then shown and so on.
Talk to non-dev folks like PMs, UX designers, sales folks, marketing folks etc. Ask them how real users are using this application. 
Read the customer feedbacks. Mostly, when someone has a bad experience, they give feedback. That’s an excellent avenue to understand their pain points.
Talk directly to the customers and understand how they use the product and what is it that they wish this software could do.
